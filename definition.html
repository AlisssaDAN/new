            <p>When it comes to suicide, our doctors always think about depression; for those who don't study medicine, they may think that this person "can't think of it." In fact, the causes of suicide are quite complex, not simple depression, not simple people's understanding of "can't imagine", it is related to biological, psychological, social and cultural factors.

                <br><br>Generally speaking, the suicide behaviors in most of the world are mainly family conflicts, marriage disputes, interpersonal conflicts and physical and mental disorders. In rural areas, family and marriage disputes are the main causes of suicide; in urban areas, interpersonal conflicts are the most prominent.
                
                <br><br>We can divide it into three aspects: biology, psychology and social culture.

            <h3>Ten countries with the highest suicide rate in the world (ranking)</h3>
            <p>
                According to the report of the World Health Organization, there are more than one million cases of suicide every year, and it is estimated that these cases may increase with the world's attention in the next few years.<br>
                I chose three familiar countries and rankings.<br>
                <br>7. Japan<br>
                Japan is a country plagued by a high suicide rate, of which 70% are men. The main causes of this phenomenon include economic difficulties, economic depression and social pressure. Unlike most countries, Japan has a suicide tradition.<br>
                <br>2. Korea<br>
                South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates, with 28.1 reported suicides per 100000 residents. The number of reported suicides in South Korea has declined recently, thanks to the efforts of the Korean Association for suicide prevention.<br>
                <br>1. Lithuania<br>
                Lithuania has a history of economic problems and is said to be the main cause of suicide.. According to statistics, 31 out of every 100000 people commit suicide, which is said to be more common among men aged 35 to 54.
