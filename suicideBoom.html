            <h1>Suicide Craze<br>In Japan</h1>
            <p>In 2014, an average of 70 people committed suicide every day in Japan. One suicide was reported, and many
                people tried to follow suit. In addition, there were "suicide holy places" such as the suicide forest of
                aomuhara Shuhai and dongxunfang. In Japan, suicide has become a kind of abnormal social problem.</p>

            <h3>The volcano event in Izu Oshima</h3>
            <p>
                In 1933, a suicide who jumped into the volcano in izudada Island caused a sensation. She was a very
                beautiful woman, so the report at that time was extremely gorgeous. The report used words like "an
                extreme story happened, the mysterious and beautiful death of women". So within a year, 944 more people
                tried to commit suicide here. Since then, there have been several more mass suicides across Japan. In
                the 1970s, Takashima in Banqiao District of Japan built a high-rise residential building, which was
                relatively rare at that time. In 1977, after a father and two sons jumped to commit suicide here, dozens
                of people jumped to the building one after another, committing suicide frequently. The media report by
                counting.

            <h2>Complete<br>Suicide<br>Guide</h2>
            <p>
                There are many reasons for suicide. In the final analysis, it can be said to be stress. Flower season girls fall into love triangle, can't extricate themselves and commit suicide; urban white-collar workers commit suicide because of work pressure; they can't face their family members when they see their report card is too poor, so they drink drugs to commit suicide, and so on. Ninety nine percent want to commit suicide, but only one percent end up doing such stupid things.
                <br><br>Suicide may be a relief from the pressure of reality, but at the same time, please think for others. What are the consequences of attempted suicide? Leave a lifelong defect; pollute the environment; leave a lifelong shadow for others, etc.
                <br><br>This chapter mainly introduces several different ways of suicide and the serious consequences of attempted suicide.
