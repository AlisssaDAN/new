            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I used to think that this kind of behavior was out of touch and had nothing to do with me, but in fact, suicide psychology existed around us. I wanted to present information about it in an interactive website way, including the causes of the psychological, different classifications and some stories to persuade people not to take this path so easily and to cherish their lives. Also I want to tell the general audience that please donâ€™t look at committing suicide in a negative way.

            <p>
                They suffered too much, and thought about all kinds of solutions. Finally, they could choose to commit suicide. It's natural that people want to escape from pain.
                <br><br>If it is necessary to blame, it should be the society itself that does not provide them with other means of liberation. We must be clear about it.
                <br><br>It is hoped that in the future, this society can change its cognition of suicide.
